            Hello, I'm Jordan Mozebo

            Originally hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo, I embarked on an exciting journey that brought me from Italy to the United States in 2014. In 2020, I embarked on another adventure by enrolling at North Carolina A&T State University.

            I'm not just a student; I'm a passionate explorer of diverse interests. You'll often find me immersed in the world of literature, devouring books, comics, and manga. When I'm not in the pages of a great story, I'm gaming, watching thrilling football matches (Go FC Barcelona!), and indulging in captivating anime.

            This website is your portal to my world â€“ a space where I share my academic pursuits, insights, and the things that bring me joy. Whether you're here to connect, explore my work, or simply share a passion, I'm delighted to have you on board.

            Feel free to explore my portfolio, dive into my blog, or reach out to me. Welcome to my corner of the digital universe!
